<a id="spvr-intro" class="anchor" href="#spvr-intro" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SPVR?</h3>

<p><b>S</b>mart<b>P</b>hone<b>VR</b> is a project to allow you to use your
Android smartphone / mobile phone as a cheap HMD. You can already find Google
Cardboard games, which run directly on your device. SPVR is used to play games
on your computer, which use the <a
href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr" target=_blank>OpenVR /
SteamVR API</a>. That is, almost all games or applications, that <a
target=_blank href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/?vrsupport=101#vrsupport=101%2C301">can be
used with the HTC Vive and offer a seated experience</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="warning" class="anchor" href="#warning" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Warning!</h3>

<p>I did this for fun! I plan to continue working on it, but it will never
provide a "true VR experience". Do not expect anything... I want to make sure,
that you don't expect anything close to an real HMD! Simulation sickness is
real, e.g., rotating your head will make you dizzy. The image quality is low
(i.e., artifacts and low resolution), like when you forgot your glasses. On the
other side, the 3D experience works, which is kinda cool.</p>

<h3><a id="how" class="anchor" href="#how" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The Android app reads out your phone's sensor data and forwards them over
network (currently udp) to the Control instance on your PC, which further
directs it to the driver instance in the game / application.</p>

<h3><a id="how-to" class="anchor" href="#how-to" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I build and
use SPVR?</h3>
<p>At least, you need to know how to build and run an android application,
since I currently don't have a pre-packaged apk. For the windows part, you can
either use the <a
href="https://github.com/burrito82/spvr.control/files/196568/spvr.zip">provided
binary</a> or build it yourself.
<h4>spvr control and driver</h4>
You can just download the <a
href="https://github.com/burrito82/spvr.control/files/196568/spvr.zip">binary</a>,
useful if you do not have any experience with C++ or Visual Studio. If you prefer
building it yourself you need:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cmake.org/" target=_blank>CMake</a></li>
    <li>Visual Studio, tested with 2013 and 2015</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.boost.org/users/download/" target=_blank>Boost</a>,
    tested with 1.60</li>
    <li><a href="http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html"
        target=_blank>glm</a></li>
</ul>
You can checkout the complete <a href="https://github.com/burrito82/spvr"
    target=_blank>spvr repo</a> by using
<br><code>git clone https://github.com/burrito82/spvr.git
    --recursive</code>,</br> which
contains the source code to <i>spvr.control</i> and <i>spvr.android</i>.
</p>
<p>Copy the glm header directory into <code>spvr/control_repo/driver/</code>.</p>
<p>
Then you need to generate project files for Visual Studio by using CMake.
<p align="center">
<img src="images/cmake-example.jpg" />
Figure: example cmake configuration
</p>
After compiling <i>spvr.driver</i> and <i>spvr.control</i>, the resulting
<code>driver_spvr.dll</code> needs to be copied into
<code>PathTo/steamapps/common/SteamVR/drivers/spvr/bin/win32/driver_spvr.dll</code>,
or <code>.../win64/...</code>, respectively. You can also activate the
<code>COPY_AFTER_BUILD</code> flag in the drivers CMake config, which will
automatically copy the dll to the given location. You just need to set the
correct <code>COPY_AFTER_BUILD_BUILD_TYPE</code> to Debug, Release, or
RelWithDebInfo, whatever you plan to build.
</p>
<h4>spvr android</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html"
        target=_blank>Android Studio</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Checkout <a
    href="https://github.com/burrito82/spvr.android"
    target=_blank>spvr.android</a>, if you haven't cloned the spvr repo, by
using
<br><code>git clone https://github.com/burrito82/spvr.android.git</code></br>
It should be easy to build and run the app.
<h4>To run spvr</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/" target=_blank>Steam +
        SteamVR</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://trinusvr.com//" target=_blank>TrinusVR</a> - the demo
        is sufficient to test if you can handle it, but is restricted to 15
        minutes of continuous experience
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://moonlight-stream.com/" target=_blank>Moonlight</a>
    - possibly an alternative to TrinusVR, completely untested</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can now start the <i>spvr.control</i> (allow network access) and run the
SteamVR compositor with
<code>PathTo/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win32/vrcompositor.exe -keepalive
-debug</code>.
</p>
After building and running the android app, you can set the IP to the address
of your computer.
<i>spvr.control</i>
should now print the received sensor data. The compositor's rendering should
move with your mobile phone.
</p>
After you established a connection with spvr and the compositor seems to work
fine, you can start TrinusVR to transfer the rendered image back to your phone.

<h3><a id="development" class="anchor" href="#development" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development and
Contribution</h3>
<p>
Contribution would be great! The current state is not great, there is actually
some undefined behavior, e.g., multiple writers on shared memory. The android
part is not implemented as a service, but instead sends sensor data from the
main thread, which android, by default, usually probihits. Much stuff is
hard-coded. On the other side, it works and development is fun!

<h3><a id="faq" class="anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true"><span
aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Frequently Asked
Questions</h3>

<p>
<h4>The download link for android doesn't work</h4>
Yes, I currently don't know how to publish an app... :(

<h4>How can I run Half Life 2?</h4>
You first need the beta of Half Life 2 (Properties -&gt; Beta -&gt; "beta - Beta
updates"). You can then start SteamVR, which will open a new compositor
instance, which you need to shut down. Then you start the compositor again in
debug mode (see above). Now you can start the game, in which you activate the
VR mode.
